You only have to complete the function.

Input Format

You are given a function,

int height_of_bt(node * root)
{

}
Output Format

Return a single value equal to the height of the binary tree.

Explanation

The maximum length root to leaf path is 3->2->6->7. There are 4 nodes in this path. Therefore the height of the binary tree = 4.
