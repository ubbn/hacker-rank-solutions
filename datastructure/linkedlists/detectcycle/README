You’re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list. Find whether the list contains any cycle (or loop). A linked list is said to contain cycle if any node is re-visited while traversing the list. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the list is empty.

Input Format
You have to complete the int HasCycle(Node* head) method which takes one argument - the head of the linked list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. Number of nodes in a linked list doesn't exceed 100.

Output Format
Check whether the linked list has a cycle and return 1 if there is a cycle. Otherwise, return 0. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

1 --> NULL

1 --> 2 --> 3
