# Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, calculate which fraction of the elements are positive, negative, and zeroes, respectively. Print the decimal value of each fraction.

# Input Format

The first line, N, is the size of the array. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array of numbers (A1,A2,A3,⋯,AN).

# Output Format

Print each value on its own line with the fraction of positive numbers first, negative numbers second, and zeroes third.

# Sample Input

6
-4 3 -9 0 4 1         
# Sample Output

0.500000
0.333333
0.166667
# Explanation

There are 3 positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 1 zero in the array. 
The fraction of the positive numbers, negative numbers and zeroes are 36=0.500000, 26=0.333333 and 16=0.166667, respectively.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10−4 are acceptable.
