The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is |a−b|. The minimum absolute difference between two integers in a list A of positive integers, is the smallest absolute difference between any two integers in A.

Given a list A={a0,a1,…,aN−1} of unsorted integers, find and print the pair (or pairs) of elements having the minimum absolute difference.

Note: More than one pair of elements may have the same absolute difference.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the length of list A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, a0,a1,…,aN−1, representing the elements in A.

Constraints

2≤N≤2×105
−107≤Ai≤107
Ai≠Aj,where 0≤i<j≤N−1
Output Format

Print the space-separated pair of elements having the minimum absolute difference in ascending order. If more than one pair meets this criterion, print them consecutively, separated by a space, in ascending order on a single line. Because we are printing space-separated pairs, some elements may appear more than once in your output.

Sample Input 1

-20 -3916237 -357920 -3620601 7374819 -7330761 30 6246457 -6461594 266854
Sample Output 1

-20 30
Explanation
The minimum absolute difference is 50 (ABS(30−(−20))=50). The only pair having this difference is (−20,30).

Sample Input 2

12
-20 -3916237 -357920 -3620601 7374819 -7330761 30 6246457 -6461594 266854 -520 -470
Sample Output 2

-520 -470 -20 30
Explanation
Our minimum absolute difference is 50. The pairs (−470,−520) and (−20,30) both have this difference.

Sample Input 3

4
5 4 3 2
Sample Output 3

2 3 3 4 4 5
Explanation
Our minimum absolute difference is 1. The pairs (2,3), (3,4), and (4,5) all have this difference. Notice that 3 and 4 appear multiple times, because they are components of more than one pair.

Note: Recall that pairs in the output must be printed in ascending order.
