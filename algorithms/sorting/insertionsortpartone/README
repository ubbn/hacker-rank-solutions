Sorting
One common task for computers is to sort data. For example, people might want to see all their files on a computer sorted by size. Since sorting is a simple problem with many different possible solutions, it is often used to introduce the study of algorithms.

Insertion Sort
These challenges will cover Insertion Sort, a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. We will first start with an already sorted list.

Insert element into sorted list
Given a sorted list with an unsorted number ee in the rightmost cell, can you write some simple code to insert ee into the array so that it remains sorted?

Print the array every time a value is shifted in the array until the array is fully sorted. The goal of this challenge is to follow the correct order of insertion sort.

Guideline: You can copy the value of ee to a variable and consider its cell "empty". Since this leaves an extra cell empty on the right, you can shift everything over until VV can be inserted. This will create a duplicate of each value, but when you reach the right spot, you can replace it with ee.

Input Format
There will be two lines of input:

SizeSize - the size of the array
ArrArr - the unsorted array of integers
Output Format
On each line, output the entire array every time an item is shifted in it.

Constraints
1≤Size≤10001≤Size≤1000
−10000≤e≤10000,e∈Arr−10000≤e≤10000,e∈Arr

Sample Input

5
2 4 6 8 3
Sample Output

2 4 6 8 8
2 4 6 6 8
2 4 4 6 8
2 3 4 6 8
Explanation

33 is removed from the end of the array.
In the 11st line 8>38>3, so 88 is shifted one cell to the right.
In the 22nd line 6>36>3, so 66 is shifted one cell to the right.
In the 33rd line 4>34>3, so 44 is shifted one cell to the right.
In the 44th line 2<32<3, so 33 is placed at position 22.

Task

Complete the method insertionSort which takes in one parameter:

ArrArr - an array with the value ee in the right-most cell.
Next Challenge

In the next Challenge, we will complete the insertion sort itself!
