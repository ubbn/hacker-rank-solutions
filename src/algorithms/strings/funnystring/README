Problem Statement

Suppose you have a string S that has the length N. It is indexed from 0 to N−1. String R is the reverse of string S. The string S is funny if the condition |Si−Si−1|=|Ri−Ri−1| is true for every i from 1 to N−1.

Note: Given a string str, stri denotes the ascii value of the ith character (0-indexed) of str. Here, |x| denotes the absolute value of an integer x.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains one string S.

Constraints

1⩽T⩽10
2⩽length of S⩽10000
Output Format

For each string, print Funny or Not Funny on separate lines.

Sample Input

2
acxz
bcxz
Sample Output

Funny
Not Funny
Explanation

Consider the 1st test case: acxz

Here:

|c-a| = |x-z| = 2
|x-c| = |c-x| = 21
|z-x| = |a-c| = 2
Hence, the string is Funny.

Consider the 2nd test case: bcxz

Here:

|c-b| != |x-z|
Hence, the string is Not Funny.
